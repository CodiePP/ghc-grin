Files:

- comp.sh:	benchmarking infrastructure, in the form of shell functions.
- hgc.mk:	common Makefile stuff, needs GNU make.
- imaginary/*:	nofib benchmark programs, one program per directory.
- spectra/*:	nofib benchmark programs, one program per directory.
- other/*:	other benchmark programs, one program per directory.
- results/*:	raw results for all experiments in the thesis (see comp.sh).

Some notes:

- Only those nofib programs used in the thesis are included.
- Most subdirectories contains a file "prel.hs". It contains the Haskell
  Prelude functions used by that particular program, and is used by
  the GRIN compiler (via CPP).
- Each nofib program has been put in a single source file. The program
  in subdirectory foo is called foo.hs. The original source files are left
  unchanged (usually called Main.hs, etc.).
- Most nofib subdirectories contains a file "Changes" describing the
  changes that has been done to the program, e.g. added Prelude
  functions, removed overloading, pattern matching made exhaustive, etc.
- Do not expect the stuff defined in comp.sh/hgc.mk to be immediately runnable.
  It contains a lot of details that are specific to my setup.
